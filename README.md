🏥 Project Title

Hospital Performance Analytics & Appointment Completion Prediction

🔍 Executive Summary

This project combines Business Intelligence (BI) and Machine Learning to analyze hospital operations, financial performance, doctor activities, patient behavior, and appointment completion patterns.
By integrating multiple hospital datasets, the project provides decision-makers with clear insights into patient lifetime value, doctor performance, revenue trends, and operational efficiency.
The project also includes a predictive machine learning model that estimates whether a patient will complete their appointment, helping hospitals reduce no-show rates and improve service quality.

🏆 Project Objectives

Analyze hospital operations to understand patients, doctors, treatments, and financial patterns.

Measure patient lifetime value (LTV) and identify key patient engagement trends.

Evaluate doctor performance, specialization distribution, and treatment load.

Visualize hospital insights using interactive Power BI dashboards.

Build a predictive ML model to estimate whether an appointment will be completed or not.

Support hospital management through clear, data-driven insights.

📁 Dataset Overview
Dataset 1: Hospital Operational Dataset

Contains patient demographics, appointment dates, visit frequency, doctor details, treatments, and billing information.

Dataset 2: Appointment Completion Dataset

Includes scheduled vs completed appointments with related patient and doctor information.

Data Integration

All datasets were merged to create a complete view of hospital operations, including:

Patients

Doctors

Treatments

Billing and payments

Appointment behaviors

This unified dataset supports BI visualization and ML prediction.
