📊 Hospital Performance Analytics & Appointment Prediction
📘 Project Overview
This project integrates hospital management data with machine learning to analyze operational efficiency, financial performance, and patient care quality. We built interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize hospital KPIs and developed a predictive model to reduce appointment no-shows using Scikit-learn.​

The focus combines Business Intelligence (Power BI) and Machine Learning to deliver actionable insights and predictive analytics for healthcare management.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze hospital operations across multiple branches and specializations

Identify patterns impacting patient lifetime value and hospital revenue

Predict appointment completion rates to reduce no-shows

Visualize operational, clinical, and financial KPIs with Power BI dashboards

🚀 Setup & Execution Guide
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/hospital-analytics-ml.git
cd hospital-analytics-ml
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyter
3️⃣ Run the Project
Data Generation:

python
# Open and run the Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook New_ML_Organized.ipynb

Machine Learning:

Train the appointment prediction model​

Two models available:

Standard Logistic Regression: 69.5% accuracy

Balanced Logistic Regression: 54% accuracy, 67% recall

Power BI Dashboards:

Open Power BI Desktop

Import CSV files: extended_doctors.csv, extended_patients.csv, extended_appointments.csv, extended_treatments.csv, extended_billing.csv

Create relationships between tables

Build 4 dashboards:

Patient Lifetime Value dashboard

Doctor Insights dashboard

Hospital Operations KPIs dashboard

Financial Overview dashboard

🔮 Future Enhancements
